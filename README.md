## üé® Sketch Effects and Techniques

### OpenCV‚Äôs Simple Blob Detection

#### Process
1. **Thresholding**
   - Converts source image to multiple binary images using incremental thresholds.
   - Detects blobs at different colors and intensities.
2. **Grouping**
   - Uses BFS to group connected white pixels.
   - Applies Gaussian blur ‚Üí Laplacian operator to emphasize blob centers.
3. **Merging**
   - Merges blobs with nearby centers.
   - Returns updated blob centers and radii.

#### Blob Detection Parameters
- `minThreshold`: Lower threshold (default: 50)
- `maxThreshold`: Upper threshold (default: 220)
- `thresholdStep`: Step size between thresholds (default: 10)
- `filterByColor`: Enable/disable color filtering (default: true)
- `blobColor`: 0 = dark blobs, 255 = bright blobs
- `filterByArea`: Minimum and maximum blob size
- `filterByCircularity`: Filter by circular shape
- `filterByInertia`: Filter by elongation (1 = circular, 0 = elongated)
- `filterByConvexity`: Filter by convexity (1 = convex, 0 = concave)

### Edge Tracing

## Edge Detection Methods
    Canny: Clean, thin edges. 

## Find Contours
    Using edges detected, connects and creates contours. 

## Add effects:
    Glitch. 
    Jitter.  
    RGB Split.
